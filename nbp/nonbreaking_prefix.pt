# add NUMERIC_ONLY after the word for this function
#Anything in this file, followed by a period (and an upper-case word), does NOT indicate an end-of-sentence marker.
#File adapted for PT by H. Leal Fontes from the EN & DE versions published with moses-2009-04-13. Last update: 10.11.2009.
#List of titles. These are often followed by upper-case names, but do not indicate sentence breaks
#Numbers only. These should only induce breaks when followed by a numeric sequence
#Roman Numerals. A dot after one of these is not a sentence break in Portuguese.
#Special cases are included for prefixes that ONLY appear before 0-9 numbers.
#This case is mostly for the english "No." which can either be a sentence of its own, or
#any single upper case letter  followed by a period is not a sentence ender (excluding I occasionally, but we leave it in)
#if followed by a number, a non-breaking prefix
#misc - odd period-ending items that NEVER indicate breaks (p.m. does NOT fall into this category - it sometimes ends a sentence)
#usually upper case letters are initials in a name
